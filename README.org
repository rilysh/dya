** dya
A tiny dynamic memory allocator.

** Example
#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "dya.h"

int main(void)
{
	struct dya dya;

	memset(&dya, '\0', sizeof(struct dya));

	dya_init(&dya);
	dya_push(&dya, "Hello world");
	dya_push(&dya, "Now is the winter of our discontent");
	dya_push(&dya, "Made glorious summer by this sun of York;");
	dya_push(&dya, "And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house");
	dya_push(&dya, "In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.");
	dya_push(&dya, "Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;");
	dya_push(&dya, "Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;");
	dya_push(&dya, "Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,");
	dya_push(&dya, "Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.");
	dya_push(&dya, "Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;");
	dya_push(&dya, "And now, instead of mounting barded steeds");
	dya_push(&dya, "To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,");
	dya_push(&dya, "He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber");
	dya_push(&dya, "To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.");
	dya_push(&dya, "But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,");
	dya_push(&dya, "Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;");
	dya_push(&dya, "I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty");
	dya_push(&dya, "To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;");

	fprintf(stdout, "%s\n", (char *)dya.ptr);
	dya_free(&dya);

** Other notes
For your purpose, you should modify the pre-allocation size.
The default size is (4098 * 18) or 73764 bytes.
